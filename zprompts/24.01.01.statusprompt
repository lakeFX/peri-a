# Project: PERI
# Current Status: Development of Integration with SharePoint and Power Automate

## Overview
- We are integrating our application with SharePoint to manage document storage and retrieval.
- We are also setting up Power Automate flows to automate report generation processes.

## Progress Summary
1. **SharePoint Setup**:
   - Discussed the necessity of setting up a folder structure in SharePoint to organize documents.
   - Identified main folders to create: `Report Templates`, `Reports`, and `Patients`.
   - Provided an option to create these folders manually or programmatically using code.

2. **Power Automate Integration**:
   - Highlighted the importance of configuring Power Automate flows at the start of the development process to facilitate functionality testing and error handling.

3. **Current Challenges**:
   - Encountered an issue with initializing the SharePoint context using `spfi()`, requiring clarification on the correct setup.
   - Discussed automating folder creation in SharePoint with code to avoid manual setup in the future.

## Next Steps
- Confirm folder creation in SharePoint and implement automation if necessary.
- Review and address the SharePoint context initialization error.
- Continue with the integration of Power Automate flows.

## Additional Notes
- Consider re-evaluating any existing code snippets related to SharePoint and Power Automate for further optimization.
- Keep track of other features and functions that may require similar document organization in SharePoint.
