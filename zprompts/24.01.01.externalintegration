# Project: PERI
# Needs Assessment for SharePoint, Power Automate, and OpenAI Integration

## Overview
To enhance the functionality of the PERI application, we need to finalize our integrations and ensure the document management and automation processes are well-structured and efficient.

## SharePoint Needs
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Implement a well-organized folder structure that facilitates easy access to templates, reports, and patient documents.
   - Proposed Folder Structure:
     - `PERI Documents`
       - `Report Templates`
         - Subfolders categorized by template type (e.g., `Medical`, `Financial`, etc.).
       - `Reports`
         - Subfolders for each report type or date (e.g., `2023`, `Monthly Reports`, etc.).
       - `Patients`
         - Subfolders for each patient (e.g., `Patients/{patientId}/Documents`) to store individual patient records.
       - `Archives` (optional)
         - For storing old or outdated documents and reports.

2. **List Configuration**:
   - Configure SharePoint lists to store metadata for templates and report generation (e.g., template details, patient information).

## Power Automate Needs
1. **Flow Design**:
   - Create flows to automate:
     - Report generation based on templates and patient data.
     - Document conversion processes (e.g., from Word or Excel to PDF).
     - Notifications or alerts based on report status or document updates.
  
2. **Trigger Setup**:
   - Set up triggers for Power Automate flows:
     - On document upload to specific folders.
     - On changes to list items related to reports or templates.

## OpenAI Needs
1. **Integration Points**:
   - Define where and how OpenAI will be utilized:
     - Generating reports using template structures and patient data.
     - Analyzing uploaded documents to extract necessary information.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Ensure that the input and output data structures align with what OpenAI expects to format while generating content effectively.

## Action Items
- Finalize the SharePoint folder structure and create the necessary folders.
- Design and test Power Automate flows to ensure they work as intended.
- Set up OpenAI integrations for report generation and document analysis.

## Additional Notes
- Review security and permissions for SharePoint folders to ensure sensitive patient information is protected.
- Consider logging and monitoring setups for both Power Automate flows and OpenAI interactions, to facilitate troubleshooting and data accuracy.
